We will only assume some beginner-level experience in programming with C++ or a similar language like C#, Java, C, Javascript, Python, etc., and will guide you from your current level to being a solid programmer who loves coding and creates amazing software 🥳. "},{"title":"Goals​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Introduction","url":"lessons/#goals","content":"What are the properties of good code? Correctness is certainly number one. And maintainability comes second, a.k.a. how easy your code is to change while preserving its correctness. Performance comes third, since it doesn't matter how fast you are if you are going in the wrong direction 😛. GOAL In this class we will focus on writing Clean Code, i.e. code that is correct and maintainable. Clean code is an essential concern when you start building larger projects that are meant to last for years. Anyone should be able to pick up your code and – within a reasonable time frame – understand what it does, what its role inside the project is, and how to modify it. Clean code is both a concern at the architectural level (organisation between modules and classes) and at the granular level (organisation inside a given class or function). We will see basic coding habits that make your code more expressive, general principles that help you organize your code, a few amazing design patterns, and we will get into the habit of using meaningful names and writing documentation and tests. We will also discover the amazing tools that are available to make our job easier and way more enjoyable. It's not about C++ Although this class makes use of C++, most of its content will be applicable to any language and any kind of programming project.

Basically a target is an executable or a library. You will define a target for your executable and describe its source files, and then you will import the targets for each library you use, and will add those targets as a dependency of your executable. Here is an example taken from p6-examples: cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8) project(p6-hello-world) add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} # Creates a target called ${PROJECT_NAME}, a.k.a. p6-hello-world src/main.cpp # And adds its source files: main.cpp and something.cpp src/something.cpp # Note that you don't need to list the header files here (.h / .hpp) ) add_subdirectory(p6) # Includes the p6 library; this assumes that you have a folder called p6 at the same level as this CMakeLists.txt file, and that the p6 folder contains a CMakeLists.txt file. target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE p6::p6) # Adds the target &quot;p6::p6&quot; as a dependency of our target ${PROJECT_NAME}.

They exist to protect you from bad practices and bugs. Listen to them! A C++ code that compiles is far from guaranteed to have no bugs! (mostly because of backward compatibility with C). This is why warnings are important! caution If you are writing a library, using warnings as errors can prevent your users from compiling your library.

GLOB_RECURSE means that it will also find the files that are in the subdirectories of src. If you only want to find the files at the first level of src you can use GLOB instead. CONFIGURE_DEPENDS means that CMake will check before every build to see if files were added or deleted, and if so it will update accordingly. Without it you would need to manually tell CMake to reconfigure each time you add or remove a file. You can then use that list of files like so: add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${MY_SOURCES}) Copy warning Every CMake expert will tell you that you should never use file(GLOB) or file(GLOB_RECURSE). The reason is always the same and can be found in the official CMake documentation: We do not recommend using GLOB to collect a list of source files from your source tree. If no CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or removed then the generated build system cannot know when to ask CMake to regenerate. The CONFIGURE_DEPENDS flag may not work reliably on all generators, or if a new generator is added in the future that cannot support it, projects using it will be stuck. Even if CONFIGURE_DEPENDS works reliably, there is still a cost to perform the check on every rebuild. I disagree with it though, since to me maintaining a list of my .cpp files in my CMakeLists.txt is more of a hassle than having to refresh CMake manually when I add or remove a file. (And CONFIGURE_DEPENDS makes it even less of a hassle). Now that you have the arguments from both sides, pick your poison. tip If it is hard to add new files to your codebase people will tend to try and avoid it, and will put more things in one single file, which might not be desirable.

There are simpler ways: Use functions to reuse logicUse composition to reuse member variables "},{"title":"What is composition?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Composition over Inheritance","url":"lessons/composition-over-inheritance/#what-is-composition","content":"In order to reuse member variables you can put them in a struct or class and add that struct as a member of the class that needs them. For example if many different classes need to have a Transform (a.k.a. a position, a rotation and a scale) you could have all your classes inherit from Transform, but you can also add Transform as an attribute of the classes instead: class Transform { vec3 position; vec3 rotation; vec3 scale; }; class Character { public: // functions that might use _transform if they need it private: Transform _transform; }; class Obstacle { public: // functions that might use _transform if they need it private: Transform _transform; }; Copy This gives you greater control over the API of the &quot;child&quot; classes. Because when you modify a parent class the change is necessarily reflected in all the children, which is often not desired. But often you end up needing to add something in the parent class because one specific child needs it, and by doing so you impose it on all the other children which don't necessarily need or want it. With composition you have greater control over that. And also composition naturally encourages you to write smaller classes instead of inheriting from one big mother class. "},{"title":"Polymorphism​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Composition over Inheritance","url":"lessons/composition-over-inheritance/#polymorphism","content":"There are many ways of achieving polymorphism, and inheritance is only one of them! And there are also different kinds of polymorphism: static and dynamic. "},{"title":"Static​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Composition over Inheritance","url":"lessons/composition-over-inheritance/#static","content":"Static polymorphism happens at compile time: it is therefore more performant, but can be used in fewer situations. Static polymorphism is achieved through templates. (And function overloads can help too): void do_something(int x) {/*...*/} void do_something(float x) {/*...*/} template&lt;typename T&gt; void complicated_function(T x) { // ... do_something(x); // This will use a different function depending on whether x is an int or a float // Our overload set has helped us doing polymorphism even though the `do_something` functions are simple and don't involve templates! // ... } Copy tip Prefer static polymorphism to dynamic polymorphism whenever possible. "},{"title":"Dynamic​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Composition over Inheritance","url":"lessons/composition-over-inheritance/#dynamic","content":"Dynamic polymorphism allows you to change the behaviour of an object or function at runtime. This is typically the use case that people have for inheritance. But there are alternatives! std::variant and std::function. std::variant​ One thing to note is that inheritance allows anyone to subclass a type at any time. This is very generic, but also very rarely needed! Most of the time you will know in advance all the possible subtypes. For example you might by writing an abstract Camera class which has exactly two child classes: TrackballCamera and FreeflyCamera. In such cases using a std::variant will be more performant, and also express the semantic better: using Camera = std::variant&lt;TrackballCamera, FreeflyCamera&gt;; Copy Since all alternatives are known at compile time, the size of Camera is known too, which means it doesn't have to be allocated on the heap! No need for pointers, new or std::unique_ptr anymore: you can simply have a Camera my_camera on the stack and use it like any old regular variable. There are no problems with copying, no weird reference semantics, no problems at all! info One downside to std::variant is that the syntax is not as nice as it could be, and it might be simpler to use inheritance. This has to be taken into account when deciding between std::variant and inheritance, and I will not blame you if you decide to pay the performance cost of inheritance for the sole reason that it is simpler to write code with inheritance than with std::variant. (Although dealing with unique_ptr can be quite cumbersome too). But remember that in some cases std::variant will be simpler to use than inheritance (and also, as always, more performant); especially if you need your type to be copiable. std::function​ std::function is an amazing type! It is basically the strategy pattern embodied in a simple-to-use type! If you need to inject behaviour into a class or if you need to pass a function as a parameter to another function, then std::function is what you need.

Managing dependencies between the different parts of your application is probably the biggest challenge as your codebase grows. Thinking about your architecture carefully, and using dependency injection, can help you handle that complexity. "},{"title":"The Singleton attempt​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Dependency Injection","url":"lessons/dependency-injection/#the-singleton-attempt","content":"One tempting solution would be to resort to the Singleton (anti-)pattern: make classes that are static and therefore available everywhere! It has the advantage that you don't need to pass an instance around (which would probably require you to modify the signature of quite a few fonctions). This makes the Singleton a really good solution in the short term. But the Singleton can end up causing a few problems, hence why most people tend to shy away from it: It prevents you from having multiple instances of the same class. Obviously you are a reasonable person and you use a Singleton only for classes that you need only one single instance of... But you often end up realizing that your assumptions were wrong and that you actually need multiple instances. I have a few examples from my personal experience: an history seems like it is unique across the application, until you realize that having separate histories for separate systems is a useful feature. And the argument to rule them all: what if you want to have multiple instances of your application in parallel? Then you can't have any static data because it would be shared accross the instancies of your application. For example think of a workspace in a drawing application: you might want to have multiple drawings open at once, each with it's own layer system, history, etc.It reduces testability: each class that depends on a static class cannot be used outside of the application. This is a big problem for testing (and also for reusing your code!). When testing we usually like to create fake instancies of the dependencies of a class to test that class. For example if you depend on a server, it is nice to make your tests with a mock server rather that the production one! The mock server could for example return a dummy answer when you make a request, whithout even having to make an actual web call. This prevents breaking things in production, or even relying on having a server running. Also you can test different scenarios – like the server beeing down – whithout having to shut down your actual server! This is also why it is nice to depend on interfaces instead of concrete classes. If you depend on an IServer you can then have different test implementations: MockServerRunning, MockServerDown, MockServerLaggy etc.It hides dependencies. Even though it is a pain to write each dependency explicitly in the signature of functions, later down the road you will be happy to be able to see at a glance what is required for a given function (when refactoring for example). It will also be easier to reuse the code later in other projects if the only dependencies are at the function boundary (aka in the signature).

Using parameters makes your functions independent of how the outside world is structured, which facilitates change. In the case of a class, receiving the dependencies in the constructor and storing them as members isn't the cleanest solution either, and you should really prefer receiving the dependencies in each method that needs them. This will make clear which parts of your class actually need which dependency. Also if you were to store a reference to the dependency, you would have to make sure that the pointed object outlives the class where the reference is stored; otherwise you would get a dangling reference! For example if your dependency lives in a std::vector, and the vector gets resized at some point, all the references to elements of that vector get invalidated! If you stored one such reference, you are in trouble! On the contrary if you pass the reference to the method each time you call it, you will not notice the change of memory address at all. If you end up with too many arguments to your functions because of all the dependencies, maybe grouping them in a struct can be a good idea. Especially because this probably indicates that those dependencies are related and that there is an abstraction waiting to be discovered and reified into a struct or class. This should be considered carefully though because it could lead to introducing unnecessary dependencies: If a class X needs 4 out of the 5 classes packaged in a struct Y, it can be tempting to make X depend on Y, although it will grab one unnecessary dependency, which is bad. But if you craft your abstractions carefully, everything should be alright and beautiful. To go further, watch Import as an antipattern - Demystifying Dependency Injection in modern Python.

What is the difference between a class and a struct?1 A class can have private members, it can have methods attached to it2, and it can use inheritance. Inheritance is kinda problematic so we are not going to consider it here (see Composition over Inheritance). We are then left with methods and private attributes, which actually both serve the same goal: enforcing invariants. tip Classes have one goal: enforcing invariants. info An invariant is a property that is always true for your class. For example, a PointInsideUnitDisk class might store its state as an x and y values, and have the invariant that the length of the (x, y) vector is always less than 1. This invariant needs to be enforced by all the methods, e.g. by deciding what happens when we call set_x(): do we just set the x and throw an exception if the length of (x, y) is now greater than 1? Do we set the x and then normalize the (x, y) vector if its length would otherwise become greater than 1? Or do we not expose a set_x() method at all? All of these answers can be valid; it just depends on the context and on how you plan to use your PointInsideUnitDisk class. On the other hand a Point2D &quot;class&quot; might also store its state as an x and y values, but doesn't have any invariant to enforce because any values are valid for x and y. In that case Point2D might be better represented as a struct rather than a class. If you don't have any invariants, you will end up with a class that only has getters and setters that do nothing special: this is basically a struct with an uglier syntax. You could also have member functions, but if your member variables all have getters and setters then you could always replace these member functions with free functions, which is a better practice anyways (see Prefer free functions). tip Prefer using a struct over a class if you have no invariants to enforce (see the C++ Core Guidelines).

This helps us maintain our code because the important stuff happens in only one place and we don't have to chase the duplicated code around in our codebase when we want to make a change. There are many ways to avoid duplications: Use a loop or an algorithm, when you want to do the same thing multiple times in a row.Use a function, when you want to do the same thing in different places.Use a template, when you want to do the same thing but for different types.Use a struct or a class, when you want to use the same group of data in different places.Use a using declaration, e.g. using Board = std::array&lt;std::array&lt;boardTile, 3&gt;, 3&gt;.Use auto, when the type is already declared in the expression; e.g. std::unique_ptr&lt;MyClass&gt; ptr = std::make_unique&lt;MyClass&gt;(); vs auto ptr = std::make_unique&lt;MyClass&gt;();.Use a macro, (😬1) when you can't use any of the above methods, and have the courage to write and maintain some ugly macro-based code. (Honestly I believe that in most cases duplications are less of an evil than complicated metaprogramming based on macros, so I wouldn't recommend going down the route of macros most of the time). If you really need macros to do complicated things, take a look at a library like Boost.Hana.Use a Python script to generate repetitive parts of your C++ code. This can often be a better solution than macros because the generated code is clean and readable, and therefore easy to debug. Arguably having parts of your C++ code as strings in a Python script can be annoying too, but you have to pick your poison. I would recommend to generate the bits of code you need in separate files, and then include those files where you need them in your C++ code. It will be simpler than having code injected directly by the script in the middle of a regular source file; you can just generate the whole file from scratch each time you run the script. Example: Python script, generated file, C++ file using the generated file. This uses this little helper script I wrote. Tip Code duplication doesn't mean textual duplication, but knowledge duplication. For example, this is not violating DRY even though the text is the same in two places: bool age_is_valid(int age) { return 0 &lt; age &amp;&amp; age &lt; 18; } bool order_is_valid(int amount) { return 0 &lt; amount &amp;&amp; amount &lt; 18; } Copy It is feasible that we will need to change order_is_valid while keeping age_is_valid the same, and it wouldn't be practical to do if the code had been refactored away. In this example the duplication is a coincidence, not a fondamental property of our domain model. See also: Tony Van Eerd, SOLID, Revisited (6min). tip To know if you are violating DRY, ask yourself: &quot;If I change this bit of code, would it be a bug to forget to change that other bit of code?&quot; If the answer is yes, then you are not following the DRY principle. tip You should avoid duplicating implementation, but you are free to duplicate intention because it is way less likely to have to change.

Yet we strongly recommend that you use a graphical interface like GitKraken to simplify this for you. The usual setup when you use git is to create a remote depot that is used as a central authority (often this is GitHub, but many other providers exist like GitLab). Authorized developers clone the content on their computer, make modifications, and push their changes back to the depot so that everyone can get it.  It is also possible to work only locally (which is great for a simple test project or exercises). Simply open a command line and type git init and you can skip the &quot;inital setup&quot; from the next section. It is still possible afterwards to publish your local repository to GitHub though. "},{"title":"Initial setup​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Git","url":"lessons/git/#initial-setup","content":"You first need to install git and go through the setup. Then you can go to GitHub, create a new account, and create a new repository (should be a green button on the &quot;Repositories&quot; left panel). Once created, you will be able to clone it on your computer. To do so, open a command line in the folder you want you repository to be in, and run git clone your_repo_url.

When you are happy with your changes, you can save them in a group that will be stored locally. To do so run git commit -m &quot;Place a description of your changes here&quot;.  Then it is time to make you local commit accessible to others via the remote repository. Simply run git push.  In order to get the latest changes from the remote repository it is recommended to frequently run git pull (in particular, always before calling git push). If you work with other developers it is possible that you encounter conflicts if you made changes at the same place in the same files. In this case, check out the section about resolving conflicts.

But did you know that we can do better in some circumstances? move is an optimization of copy. For example consider: std::vector&lt;int&gt; create_n_integers(int n) { std::vector v; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) { v.push_back(n); } return v; } std::vector&lt;int&gt; my_vector = create_n_integers(10000000); Copy It might look like we are doing a copy: a vector is created inside create_n_integers and then when we do my_vector = create_n_integers(10000000) we copy the vector from create_n_integers into my_vector. And you know that a vector can be big and therefore its copy can be expensive! All of that is true, but the above code is still perfectly fine. This is because the compiler knows that there is no need to do a copy and that it can do a move instead: same effect, but faster. So, what exactly is a move? The idea is that when an object is about to be destroyed, there is no need to keep that object intact; our &quot;copy&quot; operation is therefore allowed to modify it. That &quot;destructive copy&quot; is called a move. Why would modifying the &quot;copied&quot; object be useful? Let's take the example of a std::vector&lt;int&gt; v1. A vector is implemented as a pointer to an array of elements on the heap. If we ask for a copy of the vector (std::vector&lt;int&gt; v2 = v1;) then it has to copy all the elements of the array into a new array, because we want v1 and v2 to be independent objects. If we were to only copy the pointer, then v1 and v2 would point to the same array and modifying v1 would also affect v2, which would be very confusing and impractical. Therefore making a copy of a big vector is slow because each of the (possibly many) elements of the vector has to be copied. But if we know that v1 is no longer used, then we don't care if it points to the same array as v2! There is no way of touching v1 and accidentaly modifying v2! In that case we can simply copy the pointer and save a lot of time. tip This is the power of move: the compiler optimizes your copy when it knows that you won't see the difference between a copy and a move. So, do you need to think about move all the time? Luckily, no! It will happen automatically in places where it can. Just remember that having a function that returns a vector by value is not a bad thing because the copy will be optimized into a move, which is cheap. Another explanation The Cherno, Move Semantics in C++ (13min) "},{"title":"Implementing move for your own classes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Move semantics","url":"lessons/move-semantics/#implementing-move-for-your-own-classes","content":"For most of your classes a move constructor will be defined automatically (just like the copy constructor) and you have nothing to do. The only time when you need to implement move yourself is if your class has an explicitly defined destructor or copy constructor (see The Rule of 5). This should be rare because if all the members of your class already have move and destruction defined, then your class will get a default move and destructor that will do the right thing and everything will be fine. The only case where you would need to define destruction and move is when you manage a resource like a pointer, an object from a C api that needs to be freed, etc. Note that in the case of a pointer the problem is already solved by std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr. Please don't allocate your pointers with raw new and don't add destructors to your classes just to manage the pointers that you allocated. Use std::unique_ptr instead and you won't even need to think about destructors and move constructors. If you ever need to create a wrapper similar to a std::unique_ptr for some resource (like an OpenGL id), here is how to do it: class UniqueBuffer { public: UniqueBuffer() { glGenBuffers(1, &amp;_id); // Do whatever you need to create the resource } ~UniqueBuffer() { glDeleteBuffers(1, &amp;_id); // Do whatever you need to delete the resource } UniqueBuffer(const UniqueBuffer&amp;) = delete; // We disable copying UniqueBuffer&amp; operator=(const UniqueBuffer&amp;) = delete; // We disable copying UniqueBuffer(UniqueBuffer&amp;&amp; rhs) noexcept // Move constructor : _id{rhs._id} { rhs._id = 0; // Make sure that rhs won't delete the _id we just copied } UniqueBuffer&amp; operator=(UniqueBuffer&amp;&amp; rhs) noexcept // Move assignment operator { if (this != &amp;rhs) { // Make sure that we don't do silly things when we try to move an object to itself glDeleteBuffers(1, &amp;_id); // Delete the previous object _id = rhs._id; // Copy the object rhs._id = 0; // Make sure that rhs won't delete the _id we just copied } return *this; // move assignment must return a reference to this, so we do it } GLuint operator*() const { return _id; } // The getter for the wrapped `_id`. You can also have it as a function called id() but I like to use the dereference operator for that purpose (*my_wrapper). private: GLuint _id; }; Copy Many things to note: We disable copying because we can't simply copy the _id (the copy would refer to the same object as the original, which would be problematic just like in our vector example), and we can't create a new object with glGenBuffers because we have no idea what was stored in that buffer by users (if we were to do a naive copy constructor, then when users ask for a copy they would get a new empty buffer instead of a copy of all the vertex data or whatever that was added to the buffer). Disabling copy also prevents accidental copies of objects that are not supposed to be copied (e.g. because they are big and the copy would be expensive).We do rhs._id = 0; when we move. This is because if we don't, then when rhs gets destroyed it will destroy its _id, which is the same as what our new object is using, which would make it invalid!We do if (this != &amp;rhs). This is because someone could call v = std::move(v); (in generic code it can happen and it is not that obvious and sometimes you need to do it). In such cases without the check we would do rhs._id = 0; but since rhs is ourself we would just loose our _id!The signature for move operations contains UniqueBuffer&amp;&amp;. This &amp;&amp; symbol is called an r-value reference; it is kind of like the usual reference &amp; (called an l-value reference) but it indicates that you are allowed to modify the object and steal its resources. Basically it means that it is okay to move from the object. The move constructor and move assignment are marked noexcept which is extremely important. If you don't then STL containers like vector will not use your move and will do a copy instead (because it would be problematic if an exception was thrown while a vector is resizing and moving objects to the new location). This noexcept costs you nothing and allows great performance improvements when you store your objects in a vector, so please don't forget it! tip Make your wrappers as small as possible. Because if you need to define a move constructor in a big class then you need to tell it to move each member variable, which is tedious and error prone. Plus you will probably need that resource in several classes and you don't want to have to repeat the destruction code in each of them. You can find examples of such wrappers in GL++.

It makes it harder to reason about methods at the call site because they could use any information from the class and, if they are not const, modify any member of the class. On the other hand free functions are very clear about their dependencies: it's just the arguments of the function, nothing is hidden. And even if you pass the whole class to the function, at least it can only use the public interface of the class which greatly limits the harm it can do. NB: This doesn't mean that methods are bad or that you should never use them. If you need to encapsulate data and only access it in well defined ways, a method is the way to go. But if something can be done using only the public interface of a class, then a free function is preferable to a member function.

They will not be generated by the compiler because if you define one explicitly this probably means that the implementation that the compiler would have defined by default is not good for any of them. An example of that is an object containing a raw owning pointer: it needs to be deleted, but also when you make a copy of it you want to copy the pointed object, not the pointer, in order to preserve value semantics. If you were to copy only the pointer then the copied object would point to the same thing as the original object, they would not be independent copies. Also when the first one would be deleted it would delete the pointer that the other object also uses, and you will get a segmentation fault somewhere because the second object is still alive but the pointer it holds has already been destroyed by someone else. If you have to implement special member functions explicitly, try to make the class as small as possible. You most likely have only one member of your class that requires the destructor / copy. Then, move that member into its own class that implements the rule of 5, and in your main class use that wrapper class and let the compiler generate the destructor / move / copy. It will prevent you from forgetting to copy a member in your copy / move, or something silly of that kind. tip C.20: If you can avoid defining default operations, do. Most classes shouldn't have explicit special member functions: This is known as the Rule of 0. Those rare ones that need the Rule of 5 should be kept at a minimal size: only one member variable.

The fact that they are two different things means that we can't necessarily do the same operations on them! Strong typing can protect us from accidently doing that.

Most notably, even if std::list has a better algorithmic complexity for some operations, in most cases std::vector will still be faster in practice because it has better cache coherency (the data is grouped together in memory, which makes it much faster to access).

And not understanding a topic that the speaker refers to should not prevent you from understanding the general idea of the conference.

Il vous faudra probablement rajouter une règle de comportement appliquant une force aux boids pour les éloigner des obstacles. Vos boids suivront, a minima, les trois règles de base (Vous êtes libres d'en rajouter d'autres si vous le souhaitez): SéparationAlignementCohésion Vous proposerez une GUI avec la librairie Dear ImGui afin de pouvoir changer les paramètres de la simulation (coefficients des différentes règles, nombre de boids, etc.).

Source de nourriture : Ajouter un (ou plusieurs) point vers lequel les boids seront attirés, et qui disparaît une fois que [nombre à choisir par vos soins] boids sont passés dessus. Quand une source de nourriture disparaît, une nouvelle apparaît à une position aléatoire.Au lieu que tous les boids aient les même paramètres de comportement, faire deux familles de boids, chacune ayant ses propres paramètres. Faites en sorte qu'il soit facile de rajouter une troisième famille dans le code si on en avait envie.Faire des statistiques sur la simulation : Distance totale parcourue par les boidsDistance minimale entre deux boids jamais atteinteetc. Ajouter des obstacles en forme de cercle (ou sphère quand vous passerez en 3D) que les boids éviteront.Tant qu'un bouton de la souris est enfoncé, considérer la souris (ou la caméra si vous êtes en 3D) comme un obstacle.
