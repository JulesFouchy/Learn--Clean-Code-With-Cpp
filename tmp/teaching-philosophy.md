The aim of every class is that every student will make progress over the course of it. We have to aknowledge that our students have very different backgrounds and knowledge prior to the class, and we can't expect them to all come out of the class with the same acquired knowledge. To would mean either setting the bar too high or too low for some students.

Instead, we should assess the level of each student individually, and make that they will find resources in our class that will allow them to make progress and learn things at their own pace, starting at their own entry level.

This kinda implies that lectures are bad because they imply to give the same content to a large group of students who have different levels.
