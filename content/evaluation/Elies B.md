## Tools (3 / 3 pts.)

➕ *What you **should** do:*

- 🌞 Follow [the good practices of the Git lesson](/lessons/git#good-practices)
- 🌞 Have a [.clang-format](/lessons/formatting-tool/) file, and apply it to your codebase
- 🌞 Have a [.clang-tidy](/lessons/static-analysers/) file, and fix the problems it shows you, or ask the teacher if you don't understand what the warning means or don't know how to fix it.

➖ *What you **shouldn't** do:*

- 🌞 Committing unwanted files like your *build* folder (see [.gitignore](/lessons/git#gitignore))
- 🌞 Making no commits until near the end of the semester

## Clean Code (7 / 12 pts.)

➕ *What you **should** do:*

- ☁️ Write many small functions (<LessonLink slug="write-small-functions"/>)
- 🌞 Write small classes (<LessonLink slug="design-cohesive-classes"/>)
- 🌞 Write small structs (<LessonLink slug="use-structs-to-group-data"/>)
- ☁️ Use strong types (<LessonLink slug="strong-types"/>)
- 🌞 Use encapsulation when appropriate (`public` / `private`) (<LessonLink slug="design-cohesive-classes"/>)
- ❌ Use free functions as often as possible, and methods only when appropriate (<LessonLink slug="prefer-free-functions"/>)
- ☁️ <LessonLink slug="minimize-dependencies"/>

➖ *What you **shouldn't** do:*

- ❌ Hard to understand or misleading names (<LessonLink slug="naming"/>)
- 🌞 Duplicated code (<LessonLink slug="dry-dont-repeat-yourself"/>)
- 🌞 Overly complicated code
- 🌞 Global variables

## C++ Code Quality (1.5 / 3 pts.)

➕ *What you **should** do:*

- 🌞 Use range-based loops or algorithms, instead of raw loops (<LessonLink slug="stl-algorithms"/>)
- ☁️ Use destructors when things need to be destroyed at the end.
- ❌ Use `const` when appropriate (<LessonLink slug="const"/>)
- ☁️ Use lambdas when appropriate (<LessonLink slug="lambda"/>)

➖ *What you **shouldn't** do:*

- 🌞 Using `new` instead of a stack allocation or a smart pointer or a standard container (`std::vector`)
- ☁️ Forgetting `#pragma once` in your headers
- 🌞 Using `1` and `0` instead of `true` and `false` for your booleans

## Investment (2 / 4 pts.)

➕ *What you **should** do:*

- ☁️ Ask questions and participate in class
- ☁️ Take my feedback into account, improve your old code if need be
- ☁️ Extend your project with additional features
 working on that point.
